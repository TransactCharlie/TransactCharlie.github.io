title: Bootstrapping the Engineer
---

A friend recently asked me how she could become a *'coder'*. She had no prior experience but had recently started to modify the website for her company and has worked in SEO for a while. She started asking about this course and that course and asking if she should spend money to start.

As a largely self taught developer it got me thinking. I'm sure you can do **everything for free** or, at least, to the point where you know that you actually like the idea of software engineering as a career.

I thought it might be a good idea to write some oppinionated guides to help out my friend (and to validate my assumption). I'm going to cover the things I currently think important in the hope that they might be useful others useful in this *'coding'* thing.
