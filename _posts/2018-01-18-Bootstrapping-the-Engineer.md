title: Bootstrapping the Engineer
---

A friend recently asked me how she could become a *'coder'*. She had no prior experience but had recently started to modify the website for her company and has a working knowledge of search engine optimisation. She started asking about expensive courses and generally looking at a large spend to get going.

As a largely self taught developer it got me thinking. I'm sure you can do **everything for free** or, at least, to the point where you have enough experience to know if it is a career move you are actually interested in pursuing.

I thought it might be a good idea to write some opinionated guides to help out my friend (and to validate my assumption). I'm going to cover the things that I think are important. Hopefully, they might be useful to others interested in this *'coding'* thing.
