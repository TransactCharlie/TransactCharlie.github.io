title: Bootstrapping the Engineer
---

A friend recently asked me how she could become a 'coder'. She had no prior experience but had recently started to modify the website for her company and has worked in SEO for a while. She started asking about this course and that course and asking if she should spend money to start.

As a largely self taught developer it got me thinking. I'm sure you can do *everything* for free - at least to the point where you have proved to yourself that you actually like the idea of software engineering as a career. I thought it might be a good idea to write some oppinionated guides to help out (and to validate my assumption). I'm going to cover the things I currently think important in the hope that they might be useful to my friend and other people interesting in this 'coding' malarky.
